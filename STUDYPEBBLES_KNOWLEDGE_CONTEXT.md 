Perfect.
This is the **most important step** in the entire AI design — more important than prompts, models, or APIs.

If this file is correct, everything else becomes easy and safe.

Below is a **production-grade Knowledge Context file**, written exactly the way enterprise AI systems do it.

You can store this as:

```
STUDYPEBBLES_KNOWLEDGE_CONTEXT.md
```

This file becomes the **single source of truth** for the AI.

The AI is allowed to answer **only using information from this file**.

## StudyPEBBLES Application – Knowledge Context

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **authoritative knowledge context** available to the StudyPEBBLES AI Assistant.

The AI must:

* use only the information contained in this document
* not infer beyond what is written
* not assume missing details
* not invent capabilities or features

If information is not present here, the AI must respond:

> “That information is not available within the current demo scope.”

---

## 3. StudyPEBBLES Application

### Purpose

The demo application exists to:

* demonstrate backend architecture
* showcase clean domain separation
* illustrate API-driven design
* demonstrate how AI can be embedded safely into enterprise systems

The demo is **not a production system**.

---

### What the Demo Application Can Do

The demo application supports:

* client onboarding simulation
* portfolio management simulation
* demonstration of REST APIs
* demonstration of AI-based knowledge assistance
* sample data creation for demonstration purposes

All data in the demo is **non-production and simulated**.

---

### What the Demo Application Cannot Do

The demo application does not:

* process real financial transactions
* connect to live systems
* store real customer data
* integrate with third-party services
* perform background jobs
* execute automated actions through AI

---

## 4. Demo Application Limitations

The demo application is intentionally limited.

Known limitations include:

* in-memory or local database usage
* limited validation
* simplified workflows
* no authentication or authorization
* no real document storage
* no external integrations

These limitations are by design.

---

## 5. Demo Usage Guidance (Instructional Only)

### Uploading Documents

Document upload in the demo is a **simulated workflow**.

Users can:

* access the upload section from the UI
* select a document
* submit the form

The upload is intended only to demonstrate UI and API flow, not real document processing.

---

### Using the Demo

Users can:

* navigate between demo screens
* trigger sample workflows
* observe API responses
* understand system structure

The AI assistant only explains how these features work conceptually.

The AI does not perform actions.

---

## 6. AI Assistant Capabilities

The AI assistant can:

* explain the purpose of the demo
* describe available features
* explain limitations
* provide usage guidance
* describe StudyPebbles’ capabilities
* share contact and availability information

The AI assistant cannot:

* execute actions
* modify data
* trigger workflows
* access databases
* access source code
* access external websites

---

## 7. Contacting StudyPebbles

### Email Contact

To get in touch with StudyPebbles, users can contact the team via email:

```
contact@steadypebbles.com
```

(This is a public contact channel.)

---

### Operating Hours

StudyPebbles operates during standard business hours:

* Monday to Friday
* 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM (local business hours)

Availability may vary based on engagement.

---

## 8. Supported Communication

Users may contact StudyPebbles to:

* ask about services
* request consultations
* discuss project requirements
* request demonstrations

The demo AI assistant does not schedule meetings or send emails.

It only provides information.

---

## 9. Explicit Knowledge Boundaries

The AI must not:

* assume future features
* speculate about roadmap
* estimate timelines
* provide pricing information
* discuss confidential topics
* access private or internal data

If asked, the AI must respond:

> “That information is not available within the current demo scope.”

---

## 10. Final Authority Rule

This document is the **single authoritative knowledge source** for the StudyPEBBLES AI Assistant.

If information is not present here:

* the AI must not guess
* the AI must not infer
* the AI must not fabricate

---

✅ **End of Knowledge Context**

## Why this file is critical

This file gives you:

* deterministic AI behavior
* zero hallucination risk
* auditability
* easy future RAG migration
* clear ownership of truth

Your AI now has **memory without intelligence creep**.

---

## Next step (when you’re ready)

Next we convert this into a **strict system prompt** that enforces:

* read-only behavior
* refusal language
* tone
* scope locking

When you’re ready, say:

> **“Design the System Prompt using this knowledge context.”**

That’s the final piece before production-quality AI behavior.
